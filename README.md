# WareSet

[Paper available clicking here!](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11249574)

Repository for WareSet: a 3D LiDAR point cloud dataset from simulated warehouse environments, as first shown in the paper "Semantic Segmentation Network for Warehouse Indoor Environments from 3D LiDAR Point Clouds" [published SBR 2025]

It is composed of eight point cloud sequences, along with the ground-truth movement of the robot in each environment. The images below shows the environments along with their respective point cloud annotated sequences.

Dataset is available on google drive by the following link: [Here!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_EPDS-gvYcmqtkXfNMb0obJXTPWWKpEC?usp=sharing)
Have fun using it for your own projects. It follows the same architecture as Semantic Kitti dataset, with details [clicking here.](https://semantic-kitti.org/dataset.html) (this is the original semantic kitti website.)
