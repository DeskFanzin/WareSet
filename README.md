# WareSet
Repository for WareSet: a 3D LiDAR point cloud dataset from simulated warehouse environments, as first shown in the paper "Semantic Segmentation Network for Warehouse Indoor Environments from 3D LiDAR Point Clouds" [accepted SBR 2025]

It is composed of eight point cloud sequences, along with the ground-truth movement of the robot in each environment. The images below shows the environments along with their respective point cloud annotated sequences.
